# RainGardenTech
Harnessing nature's cycle, RainGardenTech is a project aimed at utilizing collected rainwater to sustain a garden ecosystem. This repo includes plans, schematics, and software for a monitoring device that checks water levels, freshness, acidity, and more.

## Overview
RainGardenTech focuses on sustainable gardening practices by using rainwater collected in drum barrels. This repository contains information about building and maintaining a pond that's naturally filtered and irrigates a garden, as well as software for a monitoring device that ensures optimal water quality for plants.

## Features
- **Water Collection**: Detailed plans on setting up drum barrels for efficient rainwater collection.
- **Pond System**: Designs for a pond that's filled and refreshed using the collected water, maintaining a natural balance.
- **Gravity-Based Irrigation**: Techniques to ensure water flows naturally to nourish garden plants.
- **Monitoring Device**: Software and hardware schematics for a device that tracks:
  - Water levels
  - Freshness
  - Acidity/pH levels
  - Other relevant metrics

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/RainGardenTech.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd RainGardenTech`
3. Explore the directories for pond setup, irrigation techniques, and device schematics.
4. For software components, follow the setup instructions specific to each module.

## Tech Stack
- Device Software: Python (with libraries such as RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi integration)
- Device Hardware: Raspberry Pi, pH sensor, water level sensor, etc.
- Documentation: Markdown files and CAD diagrams for physical setups

## Potential Roadmap:

- Research & Design: Before building the physical components, research the best ways to set up rain barrels, the pond, and the gravity-based irrigation system. Document everything.
Hardware Setup: Acquire and set up all the necessary hardware components for the monitoring device, including the Raspberry Pi, sensors, etc.
- Software Development: Write the software to collect and analyze data from the sensors. This would include scripts to read pH levels, water levels, etc., and potentially an interface for users to view this data.
- Integration: Ensure that the device can seamlessly monitor the pond and garden system.
- Testing: Test the entire system in a real-world scenario to ensure everything works as intended. Adjust based on feedback and findings.
- Community Collaboration: Engage with contributors and the community to refine the project further, considering diverse climates, garden types, and tech scenarios.
- The concept for RainGardenTech is intended to provide an intersection of technology and sustainable gardening. As with any project, moving from concept to a real-world application will require planning, collaboration, and iteration.
