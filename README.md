# RainGardenTech
Harnessing nature's cycle, RainGardenTech is a project aimed at utilizing collected rainwater to sustain a garden ecosystem. This repo includes plans, schematics, and software for a monitoring device that checks water levels, freshness, acidity, and more.

## Overview
RainGardenTech focuses on sustainable gardening practices by using rainwater collected in drum barrels. This repository contains information about building and maintaining a pond that's naturally filtered and irrigates a garden, as well as software for a monitoring device that ensures optimal water quality for plants.

## Features
- **Water Collection**: Detailed plans on setting up drum barrels for efficient rainwater collection.
- **Pond System**: Designs for a pond that's filled and refreshed using the collected water, maintaining a natural balance.
- **Gravity-Based Irrigation**: Techniques to ensure water flows naturally to nourish garden plants.
- **Monitoring Device**: Software and hardware schematics for a device that tracks:
  - Water levels
  - Freshness
  - Acidity/pH levels
  - Other relevant metrics

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/RainGardenTech.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd RainGardenTech`
3. Explore the directories for pond setup, irrigation techniques, and device schematics.
4. For software components, follow the setup instructions specific to each module.

## Tech Stack
- Device Software: Python (with libraries such as RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi integration)
- Device Hardware: Raspberry Pi, pH sensor, water level sensor, etc.
- Documentation: Markdown files and CAD diagrams for physical setups
